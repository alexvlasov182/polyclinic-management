      <h1 class="display-3 text-center main-title">Welcome to our Polyclinic Management system, dear guest!</h1>
      <p class="text-center">Since our founding in 1917, The Polyclinic has focused on one mission — promoting the
        health of our patients through personalized care. We’re able to deliver on this because our doctors are in
        charge. And that gives them the power to put patients first.

        Because of this, we’ve attracted more than 200 of the area’s most respected physicians and advanced practice
        clinicians. We’re also one of the largest multispecialty clinics in the Puget Sound region, with more than 12
        locations in greater Seattle.

        From pediatrics, family practice and internal medicine doctors to specialists and surgeons, we offer a single
        doorway to meeting your health care needs. Our care teams work closely together with one goal in mind — doing
        what’s right for you.</p>
